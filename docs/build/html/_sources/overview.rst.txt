============
**Overview**
============
**Makka pakka** is a programming language which transpiles into Intel
Assembly. It implements additional features on top of traditional
assembly, such as:

- Functions
- Automatic linking
- ROP replacement

The language was built to make it easier to write programs that sit in code
caves. Code cave code must be position independant, therefore, when written
correctly, all makka pakka code will translate into position independant NASM.

For instructions on how to install makka pakka, check out the :doc:`installation`
documentation.

Think something's missing? It probably is... check out the :doc:`todo` page to
